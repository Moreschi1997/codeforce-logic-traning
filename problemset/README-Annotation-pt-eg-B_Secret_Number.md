## Dividing the problems

- *A - Problem One ➡︎ Vandin has thought of a **number x**.*
    - How I Approached Problem One *:* **Vandin thought of a number x. This number is represented as the variable x in the problem.**
- *B - Problem Two ➡︎ To ensure that no one can guess it, he appended a positive of number zeros to the right of it, thus **obtaining** a new number y.*
    - How I Approached Problem Two *:*  **Quest two. It's necessary to understand what Vandin meant by the zeros on the right side of the number. To make sure no one could guess it, he added zeros to the number. Therefore *x* receive.**
